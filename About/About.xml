English, Français (by Coyote2710), 한국어 (by [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050557061]totobrother[/url])

[h1]Features:[/h1]
[list]
[*] 4 unlockable playable werewolf forms (and a hidden fifth type)
[*] Adds moons to RimWorld with a custom moon cycle system.
[*] Adds a neutral AI faction of Werewolves to interact with, or engage hostilities with to your peril.

[/list]

[h1]Startup Guide:[/h1]
[list]
[*] For a playable werewolf, you will need a colonist with the Werewolf (Unblooded) trait. 
[*] When the first full moon rises, they will go into a Werewolf fury. After they calm down, the werewolf will be able to make controlled transformations in the future for that form.
[*] To unlock and level up forms, toggle the full moon fury icon to enable further random transformations during full moons.
