[list]
[*] For a playable werewolf, you will need a colonist with the Werewolf (Unblooded) trait. 
[*] When the first full moon rises, they will go into a Werewolf fury. After they calm down, the werewolf will be able to make controlled transformations in the future for that form.
[*] To unlock and level up forms, toggle the full moon fury icon to enable further random transformations during full moons.
