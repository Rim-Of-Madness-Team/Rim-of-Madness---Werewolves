# Features:

-  4 unlockable playable werewolf forms (and a hidden fifth type)
-  Adds moons to RimWorld with a custom moon cycle system.
-  Adds a neutral AI faction of Werewolves to interact with, or engage hostilities with to your peril.
-  Adds &quot;silver treatment&quot; system for colonies with machining tables to use against Werewolf damage immunity.

# Startup Guide:

-  For a playable werewolf, you will need a colonist with the Werewolf (Unblooded) trait. 
-  When the first full moon rises, they will go into a Werewolf fury. After they calm down, the werewolf will be able to make controlled transformations in the future for that form.
-  To unlock and level up forms, toggle the full moon fury icon to enable further random transformations during full moons.
