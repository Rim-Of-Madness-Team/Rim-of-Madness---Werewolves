  Adds Werewolves to RimWorld.

  Quick Werewolf Guide
  1) Find a character with the Werewolf trait.
  2) Werewolves will unlock their first transformation during a full moon.
  3) When a Werewolf has transformed at least one time, it is called a blooded werewolf, and blooded Werewolves can learn more forms with Full Moon Fury enabled (next to the Draft button) during future full moons.
